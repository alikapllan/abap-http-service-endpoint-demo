# Demo: ABAP HTTP Service Endpoint for Creating Sales Orders

I came across this interesting topic again, thanks to [Software-Heroes](https://software-heroes.com/en/sap). In my opinion, this approach is highly beneficial for non-complex integration scenarios.

The original article, [Software-Heroes: BTP - HTTP Service](https://software-heroes.com/en/blog/btp-http-service-endpoint), explains the concept and implementation process very well.

## Overview
In our SAP S/4HANA 2023 On-Premise system, I implemented an HTTP service that allows sales order creation via an ABAP-based HTTP endpoint with the BAPI 'BAPI_SALESORDER_CREATEFROMDAT2'.  

If youâ€™re new to this BAPI, you may find [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUOiOYBQ3Rw&t=1842s&ab_channel=SathishReddy) helpful in understanding how it works and is triggered.  

The service:  
- Accepts JSON payload.  
- Deserializes it into an ABAP structure.  
- Dynamically sets X fields based on provided values.  

### For example you can see how I test the service via Postman and the result that Sales Order created
-> under **Authorization** tab I selected **'Basic Auth'** and provided my SAP credentials not to get - 401 Unauthorized error.
